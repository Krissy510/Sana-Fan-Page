                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>Sana was born on December 29, 1996 in Tennōji-ku, Osaka, Japan.<br>
                    She is the only child in her family.<br>
                    She wanted to become a singer and dancer, and was inspired by K-pop groups such as Girls'
                    Generation.<br>
                    In addition to her native Japanese, she is also able to speak Korean, having studied it since moving

                    South Korea, and basic English.</p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <h3>Pre-debut</h3>
                <p>Sana began training with EXPG in Osaka in 2009, originally planning to be a singer in Japan, rather
                    than
                    South Korea.<br>
                    During her middle school years, she was scouted by a JYP Entertainment employee at a shopping
                    mall<br>
                    and was invited to participate in the annual JYP Japan audition held the following day.<br>
                    Sana passed the audition and joined the JYPE trainee program in South Korea in April 2012.<br>
                    She trained for over three years with JYP before her eventual debut with Twice.<br>
                    At one time it was expected that Sana would become a member of a new JYP girl group.<br>
                    However, this new project was cancelled and the group did not debut.<br>
                    In 2014, Sana appeared in Got7's music video for "A" as a waitress.</p>
                <h3>2015 – Present</h3>
                <p>In 2015, Sana participated in the music survival show Sixteen, a reality television series designed
                    to select the founding members of Twice.<br>
                    Out of the sixteen contestants, Sana was selected as one of the nine members of the newly formed
                    girl group.<br>
                    She debuted with Twice in October 2015 with the title song "Like Ooh-Ahh" from their debut extended
                    play The Story Begins.<br>
                    Sana is known for her energetic and cheerful personality and has received recognition in South Korea
                    and abroad.<br>
                    Her popularity – in conjunction with that of fellow Japanese members Momo and Mina – has been
                    credited with improving relations between Japan and South Korea.<br>
                    In Gallup Korea's annual music poll for 2018, Sana was voted the 17th most popular idol in South
                    Korea, making her the highest-ranked Japanese individual in that poll.<br>
                    She ranked 15th in the 2019 poll.<br>
                    In 2019, Sana was also ranked as the most popular female K-pop idol in a survey of
                    soldiers doing mandatory military service in South Korea.<br>
                    Outside of Twice, she has done work promoting various brands and products.<br>
                    In February 2021, Sana became the first Twice member to release a single after she made a cover of
                    "Sotsugyou", a 2020 single by Japanese band
                    Kobukuro.<br>The cover, which includes an a cappella version, was released as a digital single
                    through Warner Music Japan.<br> A version with Kobukuro themselves was released in March 2021.
